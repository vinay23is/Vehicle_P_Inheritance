# Vehicle Inheritance Project

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java, specifically inheritance. It includes a `Vehicle` superclass and a `Car` subclass that extends its functionality.

## Project Overview

- The `Vehicle` class serves as a base class with common vehicle attributes and behaviors.
- The `Car` class extends `Vehicle` and adds specific functionalities like adjusting the seat.
- The `Main` class creates a `Car` object and calls various methods to test inheritance.

## Technologies Used

- Java (SE-22)
- Eclipse IDE
- Git/GitHub

## Project Structure

```
Vehicle_P_Inheritance/
│── src/
│   ├── Vehicle.java   # Base class with general vehicle properties and methods
│   ├── Car.java       # Subclass inheriting from Vehicle with additional functionalities
│   ├── Main.java      # Main class to test functionality
│── .gitignore
│── README.md
```

## Features

- Object-Oriented Design (Inheritance)
- Dynamic Method Invocation (Overriding)
- Vehicle Acceleration & Braking
- Seat Adjustment in `Car` Class

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vinay23is/Vehicle_P_Inheritance.git
   cd Vehicle_P_Inheritance
   ```

2. Open in Eclipse:
   - Import as an existing Java project.
   - Ensure the JavaSE-22 JRE is configured.

3. Run the `Main` Class:
   - Click Run ▶️ in Eclipse.
   - Observe console output.

## Expected Output

```
Vehicle created.
Car created.
The vehicle is speeding up.
Model S running at 5 miles per hour.
The vehicle is slowing down.
Model S running at 0 miles per hour.
Moving seat forward...
```
